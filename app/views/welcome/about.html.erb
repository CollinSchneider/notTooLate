      Not Too Late is a rock & roll band of 6 seasoned musicians. Each member has extensive experience performing with a variety of bands or as individual performers over the last 25+ years..… but never together in the same band.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original band concept was to tap into talented local musicians, each with a unique artistry, individual accomplishments and a repertoire of various musical offerings. This collaboration proved it was not too late to create a new group that was greater than the sum of its parts. The result is a band that can be enjoyed by a broad dance or club audience or be tailored to a smaller intimate venue.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hearing Not Too Late perform Rick Tedesco, owner of The Guitar Hanger in Brookfield, CT said….
      “I really enjoy the well played song choices and the harmonies. This is a fun band!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Each band member comes from a different walk of life and has his own unique professional and social connections. This diversity of reach translates into an extensive fan base and followers from a large geographic area.
